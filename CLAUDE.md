# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Formalization of polychromatic colourings of integers in Lean 4. A colouring of integers is *S*-polychromatic if every translate of set *S* contains an element of each colour class. The main theorem (`Lean/Polychromatic/Main.lean:final_result`) proves that every set of 4 integers admits a 3-polychromatic colouring.

## Build Commands

All Lean commands run from the `Lean/` directory.

```bash
cd Lean
lake exe cache get        # REQUIRED before first build — downloads mathlib cache
lake build                # Build all proofs
lake build Polychromatic.Main  # Build a single module
```

**Always run `lake exe cache get` before building.** Without it, mathlib builds from source (~60+ min).

### Other Components

- **Verso docs**: First run `cd Lean && lake exe cache get && lake build`, then `cd Verso && lake exe docs`. The Lean build must complete before building Verso docs, because the docs build shells out to `../Lean` to run `subverso-extract-mod` using the Lean project's toolchain. The Verso project uses a different Lean toolchain — this is intentional. Lean code is pulled into the site via `` ```anchor name (module := Module.Name) `` blocks, which reference `-- ANCHOR:` / `-- ANCHOR_END:` comments in the Lean source files.
- **Jekyll site**: `cd site && bundle exec jekyll serve` (Ruby 3.1+)
- **Generation**: C++ code in `Generation/` produces colouring log files consumed by `FourThree/Compute.lean`

## Architecture

### Lean Proofs (`Lean/Polychromatic/`)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Colouring.lean` | Core definitions: `IsPolychrom`, `HasPolychromColouring` |
| `PolychromNumber.lean` | `polychromNumber` — supremum of achievable colour counts |
| `Existence.lean` | Existence results via Lovász Local Lemma |
| `LocalLemma.lean` | Symmetric Lovász Local Lemma formalization |
| `LovaszFunction.lean` | Strauss function and asymptotics |
| `DiscreteProbability.lean` | Markov and Chebyshev inequalities |
| `Compactness.lean` | Rado selection principle, de Bruijn–Erdős theorem |
| `Main.lean` | Main theorem assembly: reduction chain → case split → computation |
| `ForMathlib/Misc.lean` | Lemmas targeted for upstream to mathlib |
| `FourThree/` | Four-colours-to-three reduction: `Theory.lean` (Accept predicate), `Compute.lean` (verification), `FourThree.lean` (case split), `Combi.lean` (case analysis) |

### Main Theorem Proof Strategy (`Main.lean`)

The proof proceeds by successive reductions:
1. **`suffices_minimal`** — normalize to sets with minimal element 0
2. **`suffices_triple`** — check ordered triples 0 < a < b < c
3. **`suffices_flip`** — handle cases where a + b > c
4. **`suffices_gcd`** — reduce to coprime cases via scaling
5. **`suffices_cases`** — split: c < 289 (computational via `allC_289`) vs c ≥ 289 (combinatorial)

### Data Pipeline

`Generation/coloring-integers.cpp` → `temp-colors.log` → `fill_in_blanks.py` (Z3) → `full-colors.log` → consumed by `FourThree/Compute.lean`

## SubVerso Dependency Management

Both `Lean/` and `Verso/` depend on [SubVerso](https://github.com/leanprover/subverso) and **must use the same commit hash**. The difference is the branch prefix:

- **`Lean/lakefile.toml`**: `rev = "no-modules/<hash>"` — uses the `no-modules` branch (non-module oleans, for projects without Lean's module system)
- **`Verso/lakefile.toml`**: `rev = "<hash>"` — uses the `main` branch (module oleans, required by Verso)

When updating SubVerso, keep these constraints in mind:

1. **Same commit hash in both projects.** The `no-modules` branch mirrors `main` with auto-generated demodulized versions. Both branches share commit hashes for most of the history.
2. **The SubVerso version must compile with both the Lean and Verso toolchains.** The Verso docs build invokes `subverso-extract-mod` against `../Lean` using the Lean project's toolchain.
3. **`lake update subverso` often changes `lean-toolchain` — always revert this.** The toolchains for both projects are intentionally pinned and should not change as a side effect.
4. **Check API compatibility with Verso.** Newer SubVerso versions may change types (e.g., `Token.Kind.const` gained an extra parameter in commit `61d4c9d`). The pinned Verso version must match the SubVerso API.
5. **`String.Pos` type change in Lean 4.28.0.** `String.Pos` became `String → Type` instead of plain `Type`. SubVerso's `Compat.lean` handles this, but only in versions from `4539e60` onward.

## Lean Style Conventions

Configured in `lakefile.toml`:
- **`autoImplicit = false`** — all variables must be explicitly declared
- **Unicode function arrows** — use `fun a ↦ b` (not `=>`)
- **Line length limit** — 100 characters
- **No multiple active goals** — each tactic block targets one goal
- **No rigid after flexible** — don't use `exact` after `simp`

Preserve `-- ANCHOR:` / `-- ANCHOR_END:` comments — they mark sections extracted for website documentation.
