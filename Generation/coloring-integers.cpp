/*
   This program is generating different quadruples of numbers and checks if integers
   could be polychromaticly colored so that every shift of them contains at least 3 colors.

   It is used in paper
   Polychromatic Colorings on the Integers
   by
   Maria Axenovich, John Goldwasser, Bernard Lidicky, Ryan R. Martin, David Offner, John Talbot, Michael Young

   The program can be accelerated by using OpenMP. For gcc, it could be compiled using:
   g++ -O3 -fopenmp
   The program does not take any input.


   The program is running trough all patterns ABC = 0,a,b,c where c <= max_c_to_try = 288
   For each pattern ABC, the program tries to find a pattern P, such that tiling integers with
   PPPPPPP gives a 3-polychromatic coloring.

   Some patterns are obviously 3-polychromatic. For example is mod 3 of 0,a,b,c  gives all three classes 0,1,2
   the coloring 123123... is good. These things are tested in function is_interesting_pattern

   If a pattern is not obviously 3-polychromatic, we try all possible periods for P up to pattern_max_size
   and hope there will be a periodic coloring. The coloring is found using backtracking.
